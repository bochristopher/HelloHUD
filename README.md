# HelloHUD

A minimalist mental fitness app designed for **Rokid AR glasses**, guiding you through breathing exercises for relaxation, focus, and mindfulness — right in your field of view.

## Features

- **Guided Breathing Animation** — A calming pulsating orb that visually guides your breath with a 4-second inhale and 8-second exhale cycle (based on the scientifically-backed physiological sigh technique)
- **Real-time Clock** — Always know the time while staying present
- **Focus Session Mode** — Toggle a dedicated focus session to stay mindful
- **Distraction-free Design** — Clean black background optimized for AR transparency
- **Rokid AR Optimized** — Display rotated 90° for proper orientation on Rokid glasses, sized for 1920x1080

## Breathing Technique

The app uses a **4:8 breathing pattern**:

| Phase   | Duration | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Inhale  | 4 seconds | Orb expands |
| Exhale  | 8 seconds | Orb contracts |

This extended exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system, helping to:
- Reduce stress and anxiety
- Lower heart rate
- Improve focus and mental clarity
- Promote relaxation
